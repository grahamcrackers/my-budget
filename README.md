# My Budget

An open source envelope budgeting application. What makes this better than other budgeting applications out there? Nothing. This is purely made because I want to use some newer technologies and have a need to start budgeting my life goals.

# Running with Docker

Running docker-compose will spin up a postgres instance so we don't have to install locally.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

- Using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) for IAM Service
- postgresql as the database
